# CVRP_GA
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) using Optimization algorithms

This project focuses on solving the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) using optimization techniques, specifically Genetic Algorithms (GA). The goal is to optimize the routes for a fleet of vehicles delivering goods to customers while considering vehicle capacity constraints.
